# Timeseries Prediction
 Exploration of methods for timeseries prediction

# Description
The two notebooks in this repository offer a exploration of timeseries prediction methods such as ARIMA or ETS. Additionally decomposition with STL method is used and statistical exploration of timeseries demonstrated.
- Notebook showing work on US realestate data [Jupyter-Notebook](US_realestate_sales.ipynb)
- Notebook showing work in daily temperature data [Jupyter-Notebook](RNN_on_classic_datasets.ipynb)

As you will see, predicting the daily temperature on small time scale succeed only to some extend, as whether shows highly chaotic behaviour. But seasonality over the year is quite deterministic.
